Chess.com rating highest 1128. Recently reached 1100 again after playing some quite nice games. Then fell down the ratings ladder again. Then again got back upto 1120. 

On Thursday night, I got checkmated within 4 moves. I did not see the Fool's Mate as its called, right in front of my eyes. So what should I have done? 
Really I should have stopped right away and come back at a later time. But I continued with tired af eyes. I lost 4 - 5 games in a row. Now my rating is back to 1045. UGHHHHHHH.
